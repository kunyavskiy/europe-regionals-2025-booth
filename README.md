# europe-regionals-2025-booth

We picked several simple problems from NWERC 2024 and implemented their solutions in Kotlin, but there’s a mistake in the code. Your goal is to find this mistake and correct it. You should only make a small correction rather than rewrite the entire code.

Find one mistake and correct it (each task has exactly one mistake) to get a souvenir at the booth! Correct three mistakes and you get another souvenir :)

Task 1: [Jib Job](https://open.kattis.com/problems/jibjob)

Task 2: [Evolving Etymology](https://open.kattis.com/problems/evolvingetymology)
